Jlooch is in the legal grey area of copyright, with open publication. I asked the creator, Brad Garton, about the license and he basically said it operates under an attribution license or he's given it to his university? It's unclear; I am not a lawyer; buyer beware, including myself. Here follows his exact reply (except the name and date):

I don't really have a strong license that covers my work.  I feel like I got very lucky getting a good academic job, and the code/software that I do is party of my 'give-back' to the community.  In a way, I treat things like "jlooch" as an "academic paper" -- the main thing is to give credit where credit is due with the original code (i.e. don't claim it as your own, or BAD KARMA will come your way.  :-)).
